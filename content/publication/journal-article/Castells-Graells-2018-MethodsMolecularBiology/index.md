abstract: When the coat protein reading frame of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is transiently expressed in leaves, virus-like particles (VLPs) are readily formed. However, after introducing genetic modifications to the full-length coat protein sequence, such as the introduction of an epitope-specific sequence within the coat protein sequence or the in-frame carboxyl terminal fusion of GFP, the formation of such modified VLPs is poor. However, by coexpression of one of these modified forms with wild-type TCV coat protein by the coinfiltration of appropriate *Agrobacterium* suspensions, VLP generation is enhanced through the formation of ''mosaics'', that is, individual VLPs consisting of both modified and wild-type subunits (also known as phenotypically mixed VLPs). Here we describe methods for the introduction of genetic modifications into the TCV coat protein sequence, the production of mosaic TCV VLPs and their characterization.
