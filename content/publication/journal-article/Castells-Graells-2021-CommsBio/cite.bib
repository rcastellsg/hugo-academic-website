AB  - Many virus capsids undergo exquisitely choreographed maturation processes in 
      their host cells to produce infectious virions, and these remain poorly 
      understood. As a tool for studying virus maturation, we transiently expressed the 
      capsid protein of the insect virus Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (NωV) in 
      Nicotiana benthamiana and were able to purify both immature procapsids and mature 
      capsids from infiltrated leaves by varying the expression time. Cryo-EM analysis 
      of the plant-produced procapsids and mature capsids to 6.6 Å and 2.7 Å 
      resolution, respectively, reveals that in addition to large scale rigid body 
      motions, internal regions of the subunits are extensively remodelled during 
      maturation, creating the active site required for autocatalytic cleavage and 
      infectivity. The mature particles are biologically active in terms of their 
      ability to lyse membranes and have a structure that is essentially identical to 
      authentic virus. The ability to faithfully recapitulate and visualize a complex 
      maturation process in plants, including the autocatalytic cleavage of the capsid 
      protein, has revealed a ~30 Å translation-rotation of the subunits during 
      maturation as well as conformational rearrangements in the N and C-terminal 
      helical regions of each subunit.
