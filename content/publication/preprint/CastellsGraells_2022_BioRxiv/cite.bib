	abstract = {Numerous technical advances have made cryo-EM an attractive method for atomic structure determination. Cryo-EM is ideally suited for large macromolecular structures, while problems of low signal-to-noise prevent routine structure determination of proteins smaller than about 50 kDa. This size limitation excludes large numbers of important cellular proteins from structural characterization by this powerful technique, including many cell-signaling proteins of high therapeutic interest. In the present work, we use molecular engineering techniques to rigidify an imaging scaffold, based on a designed protein cage, to the point where 3 {\r A} resolution can be achieved, even for very small proteins. After optimizing the design of the rigidified scaffold on test proteins, we apply this imaging system to the key oncogenic signaling protein KRAS, which represents an outstanding challenge in the area of structure-based drug design. Despite its 19 kDa size, we show that the structure of KRAS, in multiple mutant forms, and bound to its GDP ligand, can be readily interpreted at a resolution slightly better than 3.0 {\r A}. This advance further expands the capability of cryo-EM to become an essentially universal method for protein structure determination, including for applications to small therapeutic protein targets.Competing Interest StatementUCLA has filed a patent application for technology related to the work descibed.},
