I am a bioengineer and biochemist with over 10 years of research experience. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Prof. Todd Yeates at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). I received my undergraduate degree in Bioengineering from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain) in 2015, and earned a PhD in Biochemistry from the John Innes Centre (UK) in 2019 under the mentorship of Prof. George Lomonossoff.
